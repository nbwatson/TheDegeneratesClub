# The-Degenerates-Club

For my project I wanted to created a functional website for me and my friends to use.  Me and two other guys have a sports podcast called "The Degenerate's Club", that we record in our spare time.  For my project, I decided to create a multi-page site where people could come and learn more about the our brand, the members of the podcast, entertaining blogs about sports, and Daily gambling picks. 

For my project I utilized the different skills I learned in class and through our classroom.  I built with a mobile first principle, along with adding two other media queries, the tablet media (min-width: 600px) and a desktop media (min-width: 800px).  For the CSS feature I included in my project I chose to go with using flexbox to change my layout of my htmls whenever I switch between different media queries.  I also built a Navigation menu that expands and collapses when clicked on.  I utilized Java script to operate the expanding and collapsing of the menu. I also utilized JavaScript to create a information section of the Podcast host.  When you click on the different buttons, it will present different information on the host, and hide the other members information. 

I also created a Calculator for visitors to use, so they could figure how much their winnings and profits will be for a single bet.  For this I utilized Javascript to create the math function, along with creating the interactions with buttons.  WHen you are on the Picks site and you click open Calculator, it will open a new tab for you.  It will then prompt you to enter your betting amount, then it will prompt you to enter the odds and lastly it will populate the results on the screen.  If what you enter meets the criteria it will show your betting amount, the odds that were bet on, total winnings and profit.  I also set the calculator to provide an error message if the odds enter are not >100 or <-100, since there are no odds between those numbers.  Once on the Calculator site you can hit the refresh button I built, and it will reset the page, or you can hit the back to the picks screen.  Once on the Picks screen you can also click the button close Calculator, and it will close the calculator tab that was opened when you clicked the button originally.
