                        <h3>Nick</h3>
                        <p>The definition of a Degenerate. Nick spends any free time he gets gambling on anything and everything. During his unfree time he is also thinking about his next bet.  The man utilizes all of his old TVs, computers, and IPhones in order to watch as many games as possible that he has money on. Growing up in Louisville, he didn’t have a hometown professional teams to watch, so he ended up picking a bunch of random teams.</p> 
                        <p>Nick spends most of his days studying players, stats and other useless information. With all of this useless information in his brain, he now annoys all of his friends by drilling them with sports trivia.  His favorite trivia category he likes to play is "Can you tell me where that player went to college?"  </p>
                        <p>Favorite sports teams: Arkansas Razorbacks, Philadelphia Eagles, Miami Heat, and Boston Red Soxs</p>

                    <div class="tab-content" id="ed">
                        <h3>Ed</h3>
                        <p>This Degenerate loves spending his time betting on the ponies.  Ed spends most of his time cheering for things that end up disappointing him or costing him money. Whether that’s the Cubs, a Horse, or IU.</p>
                        <p>Ed dreams of one day owning his own race horse in the Kentucky Derby, but knowing his luck the horse will probably end just like Mendelssohn.  While the ponies might not reciprocate the love to Ed, that won’t stop him from betting on them.</p>
                        <p>Favorite teams: Chicago Cubs, Green Bay Packers, Indiana Hoosiers, Kentucky Wildcats, and the ponies</p>

                    <div class="tab-content" id="captain">
                        <h3>Captain Crypto</h3>
                        <p>While Captain might enjoy the finer things in life, this does not stop him from being a Degenerate in society.   Captain’s passion lies with cryptocurrency, the stock market, the ponies, and watching the Chicago Bears suck.  Captain keeps his loyalty to one city when it comes to his professional sports team, and that’s Chicago.</p>
                        <p>Favorite teams: Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bears, and Chicago Blackhwaks</p>
