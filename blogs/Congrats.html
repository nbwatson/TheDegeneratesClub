                            <h3>Congrats to the Bucks on the 2021 NBA Champs*</h3>
                            <p class="by">By Nick - July, 23 2021</p>
                            <div>
                            <p>Congrats Bucks on a great NBA championship*.  That asterisk is only fitting to put on their championship, since Lebron has one next to all but one of his championships.</p>
                            <p>Let’s not forget the Bucks had a cake walk to finals. Every team they faced in the Eastern Conference Playoffs had an injury to their main super star.  The Heat faced injuries all year on top of COVID issues.  The Nets lost 2 of their 3 super stars.  The Hawks had an injured Young.   Then when the Suns had to face the Bucks in the Western Conference Finals, the Suns had to deal with Paul being injured, lost their back up center, and Booker's face got caved in.</p>
                            <p>Sure, Giannis had that injury in the ECF, but it was hyped up to be a lot worse than it really was (thank you, ESPN).  So really I am not shocked the Suns lost; they were young, injured, had to face way more adversity, and played in a way tougher conference. During the regular season the Bucks were all over the place, and at one point were even a top contender in their own conference.</p>
                            <p>Also, on a side note, why didn’t Khawhi ever get an asterisk beside his NBA Championship with the Raptors?  They beat a Warriors team that was literally hopping on one leg. </p>
                            <p>Anyways, Giannis has not proven anything to me, and won’t until he shows he can win without the help from the basketball gods.</p>                            </div>
