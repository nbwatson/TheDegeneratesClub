                <h3>Growup Big Brother</h3>
                <p class="by">By Nick - July, 23 2021</p>
                <div>
                <p>In true Texas nature, Texas is once again throwing a little tantrum to get the attention they don’t deserve.  Every year ESPN forces down our throats how Texas is back and that we need to respect them.  And every year around the 3rd week, we watch Texas get embarrassed.  But somehow Texas stays in the top 25, even though they play in a weak conference. People out there also argue that Oklahoma is a powerhouse for the Big 12.  But once again, who does Oklahoma play that is worthy?  Oklahoma never makes it far in the CFP, and after they lose we sit back and ask ourselves, "Why were they even there?"</p>
                <p>Now it has been leaked that Texas wants to join the SEC, and it’s great peace offering is bringing Oklahoma with them.</p>
                <p>This, hands down, is the worst thing the SEC could do. What would Texas offer to the SEC?  Their soft fan base? Their strength and competitiveness as a team?  As a fellow Arkansas fan, I can tell you one thing, UT students could not handle being in the SEC every week.  I have watched Arkansas get their teeth kicked in year after year and suffer devastating team losses just to be the butt end of many jokes (thank you, Bobby).  But I know for a fact UT fans and players are not mentally strong enough to handle the SEC fans.  Every year we watch UT fans lose their minds anytime anyone throws up a Horns Down gesture.  I have never seen such a small gesture destroy someone so badly.</p>
                <p>The SEC is a grudge match every week and is so unpredictable (minus Bama winning 10+ games every year and Vandy losing 10+ games), and we don’t need another delusional fan base (I’m looking at you A&M).  At best, Texas might be an Auburn-like team, and at worst Miss State.</p>
                <p>So please stay away from the SEC, Texas. There isn't a single positive thing that you would contribute to the SEC, and Arkansas has no interest in renewing our SWC rivalry.</p>
                <P><strong>As always, HORNSDOWN!</strong></P>
