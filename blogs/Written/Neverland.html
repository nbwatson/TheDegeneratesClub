                <h3>Neverland is Coming to an End</h3>

                    <p>This years' NBA finals was a hard realization for me that all of the NBA stars I grew up watching are about to call it quits. Don’t get me wrong, I loved watching CP3 finally make his NBA Finals debut. And I know for a fact this would’ve happened 4-6 more times if the NBA didn’t deny the CP3 trade to the Lakers. But watching the Finals was a wake up call that I’m finally turning into an old man.   All I did was sit and complain about the game style of play and the officiating.</p>
                    <p>The NBA that I grew up loving was all about going 100mph and trying to outdo the other player.  Now it’s just a bunch of grown men taking too many 3’s and complaining 24/7 about not getting a call.  It has even gotten to the point where the players have rubbed off on the commentators, and they sit and complain about every call and feel as if their opinion actually matters. What happened to just calling the game live and unbiased and maybe telling an old story that reminds you of the game?</p>
                    <p>As the Bucks celebrated I couldn’t help but think, when will the NBA be fun and exciting to watch again?  When will players play the game for the game and not for money or fame?</p>
                    <p>Maybe one day we can have a player come around and raise the bar of play.</p>
