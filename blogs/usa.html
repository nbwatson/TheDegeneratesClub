                            <h3>USA Stinks Again</h3>
                            <p class="by">By Nick - July, 27 2021</p>
                            <div>
                            <p>I provided this easy profit for the gamblers with France at +13.5.  As I joked with my friends saying don’t be shocked if the USA loses, I now regret not putting my money where my mouth is.  This loss is a great example of why the future of the NBA is not looking good.</p>
                            <p>The league is mostly full of players with no killer instinct or self-respect .  Olympic play is all about one thing, team ball.  You have the most talented players in the world on the team, but none of them know how to play with one another.  The Redeem Team was the best showcase of team basketball.  D-Wade came off the bench and led all players in points. Even though everyone knew he should be a starter, he understood his role and what team ball meant. That team killed every opponent they played and made sure everyone knew the team’s only goal, win the gold medal.  That year there you wouldn’t have witness any careless turnovers, a loose ball not dived after or a blow defensive assignment.</p>
                            <p>The Olympics should be another NBA All-Star game for these players, except this time you don’t have to worry about sharing your playing time with the faces of the league.  Sure you could blame the struggles on no elite veterans on the team, or Coach Pop doesn’t have it any more.  But the blame goes on the players and the NBA.  This was suppose to be a showcase and introduction of the leagues young stars and middle of the pack veterans.  However to me it has displayed that the league have an issue with developing its younger players.  Look at how Luka has taken over the NBA and the olympics.</p>
                            <p>Call me unpatriotic, but this team has no will to win or desire to be there.  That was shown during the exhibition games and was also solidified Sunday night.</p>
                            <p>The spread for the Iran game opened at +32 and will probably be climbing up, because people will think the USA will bounce back.  I will be riding with Iran to cover the spread.</p>
